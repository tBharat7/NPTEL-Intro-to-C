You are given a sorted(either in the increasing or in the decreasing order) sequence of positive numbers, ending with a -1. You can assume that there are atleast three numbers before the ending -1. 

Note : -1 is not a part of input. It only signifies that input has ended.

Let us call the sequence x0  x1 ... xn -1.

You have to output 1 if there are atleast three distinct numbers in the sequence.
otherwise output 0

Kindly do not use arrays in the code.

//anwser
#include<stdio.h>

int main()
{
 int a,b;
 int c=1;
 scanf("%d",&a);
   for(;;)
   {
       
       scanf("%d",&b);
       if(b==-1)
       {
           printf("0");
           break;
       }
       
       if(a!=b)
       {
         a=b;
         c = c+1; 
         if(c==3)
         {
             printf("1");
             break;
         }
           
       }
       
       
       
   }

return 0;
}
